# Dynamic Content Updater (Browser)

Build a page that reads and modifies DOM elements:
- Create a page with multiple elements (headings, paragraphs, images)
- Add buttons that change text content
- Add buttons that modify attributes (change image src, link href)
- Add buttons that toggle CSS classes
- Display current state of elements
- Use querySelector and querySelectorAll effectively

**Requirements**
- One HTML page with at least: one heading, one paragraph, one image, one link. Use only concepts from Module 5 (DOM selection, reading content, modifying textContent/attributes/classes). No event listeners required for full credit (buttons can use inline handlers if needed, or use Lesson 6.1 addEventListener).
- At least two buttons that change text content; at least one that changes an attribute (e.g., image src or link href); at least one that toggles a CSS class.
- Use `querySelector` and/or `querySelectorAll` to get elements. Check that elements exist before using them when appropriate.

**Submission**
Submit your HTML file and any CSS/JS files. The page should work in a modern browser.
